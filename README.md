# fruitgarden
It is a little project for me to practice my programming skils.

This is an analog game, which is the favorite game of my dauther

In this game thy players have to harvest alle the fuits, bevor the raven is still in the garden.

The dice have four sites of colour (red, yellow, blue and green). The colour stand für the fruits (red, green = apple, yellow = pear, blue = plum).
One side is the raven. The last one ist the basket.

How to play:

The player roll the Dice. When it´s landing on a colour, the player can take a fruit of the colour and put them in the basket.
When the dice is landing on the basket, the player can take any fruit.
When the player roll a raven, than the raven is coming nearer to the garden.
Has the player harvest all fruits bevor the raven is in the garden, the game is won.
Is the raven in the garden bevor all fruits harvest, the game is lose.
